						<h2>Michelin Star Factors & Attribute</h2>
						<p>
							Data Science project using scikit-learn Machine Learning Model
						</p>
						<p>
							Everyone has an idea of what makes a restaurant upscale: we associate factors like expensive food, special cuisine, and a fancy name to mean a place has higher ratings. In this project, we are using data from the Michelin Star Restaurant Guide to find out if these factors really do make a restaurant more likely to gain stars. We then compare this to data from Yelp to see if these factors correlate to those of restaurants on Yelpâ€™s site. We used visualizations and predictive models to determine if there is any significance in cuisine, price, or name and higher ratings.
